# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Implementation with Churn Modelling Dataset

![Neural Network](neural_network_image.jpg)

This repository contains code and resources for implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the Churn Modelling dataset. An ANN is a powerful machine learning model inspired by the human brain's neural networks, and it's widely used for various tasks, including predicting customer churn.

## Project Overview

Customer churn, which refers to the loss of customers, is a critical concern for businesses across various industries. Predicting and understanding customer churn is essential for customer retention and business growth. This project focuses on implementing an ANN to predict customer churn using the Churn Modelling dataset.

## Dataset: Churn Modelling

The "Churn Modelling" dataset contains information about bank customers and whether they exited (churned) or stayed with the bank. The dataset includes the following features:

- **CustomerId**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Surname**: The customer's surname.
- **CreditScore**: The credit score of the customer.
- **Geography**: The customer's country of residence.
- **Gender**: The customer's gender.
- **Age**: The customer's age.
- **Tenure**: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: The account balance of the customer.
- **NumOfProducts**: The number of bank products the customer uses.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card.
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member.
- **EstimatedSalary**: The estimated salary of the customer.
- **Exited**: Whether the customer exited (1) or stayed (0) with the bank (target variable).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python**: You should have Python installed on your system.

- **Jupyter Notebook (Optional)**: For running and experimenting with code, Jupyter Notebook is recommended.

- **Deep Learning Framework**: Install the necessary deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or Keras, as specified in the project code.

- **Data Preprocessing Libraries**: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn are used for data preprocessing and analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the Churn Modelling dataset. This includes data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

2. **Model Architecture**: Define the architecture of the ANN model, including the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions.

3. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

4. **Training**: Train the ANN model using the training dataset. Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures to optimize model performance.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the ANN's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizations.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)**: Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved model accuracy.

7. **Conclusion**: Summarize your findings, discuss the ANN's performance, and provide insights into predicting customer churn.
